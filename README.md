Script to check for new versions and update Forge for linux by Asta1986.
Local profile file is kept to maintain customized paths.

USAGE: In a terminal run 'bash forge-updater'. When prompted for the Forge directory, enter the full path without
trailing /.

IMPORTANT: If you choose to replace the local version with a new one, make sure your user and cache
directories are not within the game directory (this is the default scenario).
